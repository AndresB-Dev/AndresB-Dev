## About me

Hi!, I'm Andres, a beginner web developer. I started coding 4 years ago and I knows the basic knowledges of programming (variables, loops, constants, functions and POO). Currently I am frontend developer, but in the future maybe I'm gonna learn backend.

Before talking about my programming skills, I said before, I started coding 4 years ago, when I started, the first coding language I learned was python, after learning that, I was not very introduced in the programming world, so after learning python I started with C# and a little bit C++. After this, I joined in the web development world, and I started learning javascript (and now this the main language what I code). And currently I'm learning javascript frameworks like VueJS and ReactJS.
